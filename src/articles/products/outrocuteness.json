        "„Pope Francis endorses Donald Trump for president” was a news-meme shared on Facebook beyond control, which now they classify as fake news.",
        "Of course, critique instantly recognized it as an untrue piece of propaganda, but it was too slow, too conservative.",
        "At the same time, pope mutated in news feed, messages, brains.",
        "Truth on his support was redundant against already working new strategy of survival and replication within environment of psilocybin real that Trump-mould mastered to perfection.",
        "Does it matter whether decision was conscious or not and whether was he aware of his own lies? He’s the first warrior against the pathology of fake news! The mixture of his testosterone and narcissistic ego, contingent product of his genotype melted with inherited capital. No reason in developing coherent, credible image. You better generate information, write contradictory posts, create chaos, affect bodies... And then all it goes, sharing escalates more sharing taking social media into unpredictable states.",
        "Social media is a space for the other, algorithmic rationality, which ‘is no longer concerned with the correlation between truths or ideas on the one hand, and proofs or facts on the other, but is instead overcome by a new level of automated communication enabled by the algorithmic quantification of affects.’ Propagation of information at whatever rate on truth-scale is rational politics.",
        "Binary critique writes reports on Trump lying all the time, check facts, but as a machine does not have enough computational power, information spreads too fast, with multiple copies, without source. What critique can do today? It can, for example, produce flip-flops with Trump’s contradictory tweets. It’s now in comfortable position for a loser, endowed with truth and irony, which anyway gets commodified and sold."
