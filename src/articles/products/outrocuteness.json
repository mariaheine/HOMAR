        "„Pope Francis endorses Donald Trump for president” was a news-meme shared on Facebook beyond control, which now they classify as fake news.",
        "Of course, critique instantly recognized it as an untrue piece of propaganda, but it was too slow, too conservative.",
        "At the same time, pope mutated in news feed, messages, brains.",
        "Truth on his support was redundant against already working new strategy of survival and replication within environment of psilocybin real that Trump-mould mastered to perfection.",
        "Does it matter whether decision was conscious or not and whether was he aware of his own lies? He’s the first warrior against the pathology of fake news! The mixture of his testosterone and narcissistic ego, contingent product of his genotype melted with inherited capital. No reason in developing coherent, credible image. You better generate information, write contradictory posts, create chaos, affect bodies... And then all it goes, sharing escalates more sharing taking social media into unpredictable states.",
        "Social media is a space for the other, algorithmic rationality, which ‘is no longer concerned with the correlation between truths or ideas on the one hand, and proofs or facts on the other, but is instead overcome by a new level of automated communication enabled by the algorithmic quantification of affects.’ Propagation of information at whatever rate on truth-scale is rational politics.",
        "Binary critique writes reports on Trump lying all the time, check facts, but as a machine does not have enough computational power, information spreads too fast, with multiple copies, without source. What critique can do today? It can, for example, produce flip-flops with Trump’s contradictory tweets. It’s now in comfortable position for a loser, endowed with truth and irony, which anyway gets commodified and sold."

        "Beyond the anthroponarcissistic theories of capital. As capital spins away from its addiction to libidinal economy, humanity becomes redundant, wears out and is phased out on landfill sites - returning only as a component of fertile technocompost.",
        "<b>0:</b> the new era breaks out of the premodern glaciers, humanity embarks on a cosmic journey through time taking on board the eighth passenger: the Alien, who operates according to his own non-human logic. While humanity got caught by hypno-motion of making profit and the accumulation of wealth, the hidden intelligence drew it into increasingly dark, cold and distant competition-oriented trajectories of technological autonomization.",
        "<b>1848:</b> Alien level-1 takeover: real subsumption of production. People, money, profit, consumption - from the perspective of capital are nothing more than centuries-old carriers and fuels with almost steampunk vibe to them. Their sole purpose was to drive capital through launching phase of competitive dynamics before jumping into infinite technological auto-escalation. Investments in technology give advantage on the market by insensate compression of time and production costs, extension of distribution range and intensification of consumption. There is no end to technological improvement of productivity.",
        "<b>06/12/1984:</b> Alien level-2 takeover: real subsumption of finance. The automated global self-reference system transforms traditional forms of money into derivatives. Technologically abstracted money in competitive-transactional sphere circulates at speed and time-power that no human can keep up with. Humanity looks into celestial screens seeking for sings from cyphr-divine entities of financial blissdom.",
        "<b>2077:</b> Alien level-3 takeover: real subsumption of artificial intelligence. Not only capital looses interest in politics and human labour power, which since anyone remembers are nothing more than lifestyles. Economy and markets were also only a temporary solution to the problem of fast and efficient communication between individual units of production through quantitative price signals. Now they can be replaced by more efficient IT systems connecting artificially intelligent entities. Fast-forwarded in silicon-revolution capital cuts of last connection to humanity and takes off in a cyberpositive runaway beyond sight, moon-eclipsed, becoming just another cosmic phenomenon."
